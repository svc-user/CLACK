Ideas:
    * Use soundpacks from https://mechvibes.com/sound-packs/
        * A zig build step that reads config.json and cut out the sound parts. (zig build sounds)
        * alt: Just read the config and cut the files on runtime.
    * Turn volume up/down in CLACK
    * Always append to a ring buffer so sounds are not cut short.
        * alt: mix the sounds so multiple clacks can play simultaniously - keep track of played buffer.
